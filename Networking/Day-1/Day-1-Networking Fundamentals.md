# Networking Fundamentals

## **Objective**
**Build a strong networking foundation from zero**

## **Topics**

### **What is Networking?**

Networking is the process of connecting two or more devices so they can communicate and share data.

### **LAN / WAN / VPN / Internet Concepts**

---

### **LAN (Local Area Network)**

A **LAN** is a network that connects devices within a **small, localized area** such as a home, office, or school.

It allows devices to share:
- Files
- Printers
- Internet access

Common technologies used in a LAN:
- **Ethernet**
- **Wi-Fi**

---

### **WAN (Wide Area Network)**

A **WAN** connects **multiple LANs** over **large geographical distances**, such as between cities or countries.

It enables communication between remote locations using:
- **Leased lines**
- **Satellite links**
- **Public Internet**

---

### **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**

A **VPN** creates a **secure, encrypted tunnel** over a public network (such as the internet).

It provides:
- **Privacy**
- **Security**
- **Access to restricted/private resources**

Users experience connectivity **as if they are directly connected to a private network**.

---

### **Internet**

The **Internet** is the **global network of interconnected computers and networks** that operate using the **TCP/IP protocol suite**.

It enables:
- Worldwide communication
- Information sharing
- Access to services such as:
  - Websites
  - Email
  - Cloud applications

### **LAN vs MAN vs WAN Comparison**

| Feature        | LAN                         | MAN                          | WAN / Internet               |
|----------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Area Covered   | Local (Room / Building)     | City / Metropolis            | Global (Country / World)     |
| Data Speed     | Very High                   | Moderate                     | Lower                        |
| Cost           | Low                         | Moderate                     | High                         |
| Transmission   | Ethernet, Wi-Fi             | Fiber Optics, Microwave      | Satellite, Leased Lines      |
| Error Rate     | Very Low                    | Moderate                     | High                         |

### **OSI Model**
**All layers explained with simple examples**

---

### **TCP/IP Model**
**Architecture and differences from OSI**

---

### **MAC, IP, ARP Basics**

---

### **TCP vs UDP**
**Use cases — SSH vs DNS vs HTTP**

---

### **Packets, Ports, MTU**

---

## **Instructor Teaching Tip**
**Use real-world analogies**  
OSI is like a **food delivery pipeline** 🍔🚚

---

### **Hands-on Labs**
- Check IP address of the system  
- View ARP table

## **Packet Capture (Intro)**
**Capture packets using `tcpdump`**
