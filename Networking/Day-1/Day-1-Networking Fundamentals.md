1. Networking Fundamentals
Objective: Build foundation from zero.

Topics:

What is Networking?


LAN/WAN/VPN/Internet concepts


OSI Model (All layers + simple examples)


TCP/IP Model & differences


MAC, IP, ARP basics


TCP vs UDP (use cases — SSH vs DNS vs HTTP)


Packets, Ports, MTU


Instructor teaching tip:
 Use real analogy — OSI like a food delivery pipeline.
Labs:
Check IP of system, view ARP table


Capture packets with tcpdump (intro only)
